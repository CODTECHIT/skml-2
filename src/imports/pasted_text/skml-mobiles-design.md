# SKML Mobiles — Figma Design Prompt
*(Reference: dynamokart.com layout, adapted to blue/teal tech identity + mobile-only catalog)*

---

## 1. PROJECT BRIEF (paste this as context in Figma AI / give to designer)

Design a complete, responsive e-commerce website UI for **SKML Mobiles**, a mobile phones, accessories, spares & service retailer based in Yellamanchili, Anakapalli District, Andhra Pradesh. The business sells **both retail and wholesale**, has a physical store (running since 2023), and wants a modern marketplace-style website similar to DynamoKart's layout — but rebuilt entirely in a **blue/teal tech, trustworthy** visual identity suited to a mobile/electronics brand (not the orange/navy DynamoKart palette).

Design for **Desktop (1440px)**, **Tablet (768px)**, and **Mobile (390px)** breakpoints, with a **bottom tab bar on mobile** replacing the top nav (Home / Categories / Cart / Orders / Profile).

- **Product management table:** image thumb, name, category, price, stock qty, status toggle, edit/delete icons
- **Order management:** kanban-style or tabbed table by status, with bulk action bar

## 10. DESIGN TONE SUMMARY

Keep DynamoKart's proven **information density and card-grid marketplace rhythm**, but swap its navy/orange "general marketplace" feel for a **focused, trustworthy mobile-tech identity**: cleaner cyan-blue accents, teal-dark surfaces for header/footer/hero, and category iconography centered entirely on phones, accessories, spares, and service — reinforcing SKML Mobiles as a specialist store, not a generic marketplace.
